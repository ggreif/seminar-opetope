Higher-dimensional Trees
========================

Polynomial functors (iterated construction)



Zooms and Complexes
===================


Input data: (planar) trees (the nth dimension)

Freely decorate with disks (adhere to rules)

 - disk must cut branch, but nothing else

Translate to tree in the (n+1)th dimension

branch =|
dot => (unit) branch
disk => dot
